# <u>**HBM Nuclear Tech Mod - 1.12.2 Warfactory fork **</u>

This is my 1.12.2 custom version abandoned HBM 1.12.2 Extended editon by Alcater
which is forked from the fork made by [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the port made by [Drillgon200](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is ported from the original mod made by [HBMTheBobcat](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).

Goal of the project is to:
– Prepare it for Warfactory 1.12 event 
– Address poor quality code of the project

We welcome attempts at porting stuff though we do not provide support outside context of warfactory.
